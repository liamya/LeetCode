## Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and 
two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead 
be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, 
where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n 
elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

### Example
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

### Solution (C++)
Have three pointers, p1, p2, p_merged. All of them should start at the end of the arrays, 
and we set the last element in the merged list to the bigger element of the two. 

```
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        //ptr_merged = n+m - 1;
        int ptr1 = m - 1;
        int ptr2 = n - 1;

        for (int ptr_merged = n+m - 1; ptr_merged >= 0; ptr_merged--){
            // base case: pointer has reached start of array
            if (ptr1 < 0){
                nums1[ptr_merged] = nums2[ptr2];
                ptr2--;
            }
            else if (ptr2 < 0){
                nums1[ptr_merged] = nums1[ptr1];
                ptr1--;
            }
            else if (nums1[ptr1] >= nums2[ptr2]){
                // ptr1 has larger element => take it 
                nums1[ptr_merged] = nums1[ptr1];
                ptr1--;
            }
            else {
                // ptr2 has larger element => take it 
                nums1[ptr_merged] = nums2[ptr2];
                ptr2--;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Remove Element
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k (❗ EDIT: the exercise had a mistake on leetcode. it is supposed to return the pointer of the last element, so it should be k-1)

 ### Example
- Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
- Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_] (❗ EDIT: should return 1)
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

### Solution (C++)
The idea is to go through nums from left to right. We skip values that are equals val but with a pointer, we keep track of the last element which was val to insert the next element which is not val.
When we insert a valid element, we increment our pointer.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int ptr = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if (nums[i] == val){
                // skip and do nothing, we increment i in the next iteration
            } else{
                nums[ptr] = nums[i];
                ptr++;
            }
        }
        return ptr; // required to return pointer of last element
    }
};
```
